# National Housing Registry

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Describe briefly in 2-3 sentences what your project is about. About 250 characters is a nice length! 
1.	Universal registration: every residential property intended for lease must be recorded in the NHR. The system assigns a Unique Property ID (UPID)to each home. No person can legally occupy or rent property without a system-generated Lease Authorization Code.
2.	The digital trust score: the NHR tracks the financial performance of every tenant.
. Active status: granted to citizens with a history of on-time payments
. Suspended status: triggered automatically the moment a payment is missed or a lease is breached.
3.	National lockout Protocol the “Suspended” status acts as a national digital barrier. Once a individual is marked as “Untrusted” due to non-payment:
. They are electronically blocked from signing any new lease in the country
. the system notifies all current and future landlords that the individual has failed the National Reliability Standard. 
. this status remains until all debts are cleared and the penalty period is served.



## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

The current rental market suffers from a “trust deficit” caused by a lack of centralized data.
Currently, landlords take a massive financial risk every time they rent to a stranger because:
•	Information Asymmetry: landlords cannot see a tenant’s real-time payment history across previous properties.
•	The “Sovereign Default” of Tenants: when a tenant stops paying, the legal process to remove them is slow and expensive, leading to “professional squatters” who move from house to house, repeating the same behavior.
•	Lack of consequence: in the current manual system, a tenant can fail to pay at one house and move to another nearby without any systemic barrier stopping them.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

The NHR acts as a Digital Gatekeeper.
•	Landlords use it to vet applicants instantly.
•	Tenants maintain a "Housing Passport."
•	The System automatically monitors monthly payments. If a payment is missed, the tenant's status turns "Red" nationwide.


This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   # A simplified look at the "Eligibility Logic"
def check_tenant_status(payment_history, current_date):
    for payment in payment_history:
        if payment['status'] == 'Overdue' and payment['days_late'] > 3:
            return "RED: SUSPENDED" # National Lockout Triggered
        
    return "GREEN: CERTIFIED"

# Example Tenant Data
tenant_01 = {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "history": [{"month": "Jan", "status": "Paid", "days_late": 0},
                {"month": "Feb", "status": "Overdue", "days_late": 5}]
}

print(f"Status for {tenant_01['name']}: {check_tenant_status(tenant_01['history'], 'March')}")
main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
3.	 Data & AI Techniques(for Small data)
Starting from scratch, the system will build its own database by integrating with National ID systems and Banking APIs.
•	Expert-based Heuristics (Rule-Based AI): at the start, I don’t need a complex “black box” AI. I use Hard-Coded Logic: if payment>3 days late, status red. As data grows, you switch to machine learning to find deeper patterns.
•	Synthetic Data Generation: i can use AI to create “fake” but realistic tenant profiles to train your models. This allows me to test how the system reacts to “untrusted” behavior before the first real bad tenant even signs a lease.
•	Transfer Learning: i can use AI models already trained on banking or Credit Card Data. These models already “understand” what a risky person looks like financially, and I simply “fine-tune” them for the housing market.


## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?
The system is a financial tool, not a physical one. It cannot stop "off-grid" cash rentals, and it doesn't physically remove tenants (landlords still use legal eviction). It also doesn't solve the underlying poverty that causes missed payments, requiring a balance between strict rules and social support.

## What next?

Integration with the "Social Credit" Ecosystem
The NHR can expand beyond housing to become a National Reliability Passport.
•	Cross-Sector Trust: A "Green Status" in the NHR could automatically qualify a citizen for lower interest rates on car loans,… or even "no-deposit" utility connections (electricity, water, internet).
•	Employment Verification: Employers could request an "NHR Clearance Certificate" as part of their hiring process to ensure the candidate is a responsible and disciplined individual.
2. Predictive AI & "Early Warning" Systems
As the dataset grows over several years, the AI moves from tracking the past to predicting the future.
•	Risk Forecasting: The system could identify "Financial Stress Patterns" (e.g., a tenant starts paying 2 days later each month). The AI would flag this to the government or social services to intervene before the tenant defaults and gets "locked out."
•	Market Stability Models: The NHR can provide the government with real-time heatmaps of the economy. If defaults are rising in one specific city, the government can react to an economic crisis before it spreads.
3. Automated "Smart Contracts" (Blockchain Evolution)
The project could transition into a fully automated legal system.
•	Self-Executing Leases: Using Blockchain, the lease becomes a "Smart Contract." If the digital payment is not detected by midnight on the 1st, the digital locks on the apartment could automatically revoke access codes, and the "Untrusted" mark is published instantly to the ledger.



## Acknowledgments

This is an original concept developed to fix gaps in the housing market. While Gemini (Google AI) assisted in structuring the proposal and refining the professional language, the core logic of the national "lockout" and payment-tracking registry is a unique idea created from scratch.
